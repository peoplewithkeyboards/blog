	Blogging requirements:
		No spying
			Me - I won't spy on you
			Them - I won't willingly allow other companies to spy on you or me
		Static Generator - easiest for search engines
		Not too complicated - I forget things easily
		Abyss - Easily allow custom html/css/js so I can go into the abyss if I want to
		Boilerplate code - layout, atom, etc.
